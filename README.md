# Climate Analysis Using SQLAlchemy and Flask API

### Description: 
A basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database is performed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The code connects to an SQLite database and reflects the tables into classes that are saved to variables. Then, links python to the database by creating a session. The code uses precipitation data to plot precipitation over a period of time. The code also uses temperature data to plot the frequency of temperature as a histogram.
